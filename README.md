# C-spine-DL-ShapePrediction
This repository contains the final project submission for STATS 507: a deep learning project focusing on cervical spine (C-spine) geometry prediction. The project evaluates and compares the performance of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for predicting spine shapes based on demographic and CT scan data.


# Contents
MLP and CNN Models: Due to file size constraints, the models are stored in separate files for easier download and use.
Data Files: The dataset consists of 170 subjects, provided in .mat format (350 MB). Please ensure the input data contains all 170 subjects for optimal performance, as the models are tuned for this batch size.

# Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following:
Python environment: Compatible with the provided .ipyenv file (28.5 MB x 2) 


# Instructions for Use
Download the Required Files:
Due to the large file sizes, please download the models and dataset files separately to avoid errors.

# Set Up the Environment:
Use the .ipyenv file to replicate the development environment.

# Model Evaluation:
The models can be tested for RMSE and visualization of predictions against the actual data.
